# Advance Computer Vision

Subprojects covered in this are:
- **Hand Tracking**
- **Pose Detection**

We will use these as baseline to build advance projects like: 
- **Counting with hand gestures.**
- **Sign Language**
- **Gestures controls**
- **Activity Recognition**

Furthermore, this will advance to.
- **Activity Recognition**
  - Walking detection
  - Running detection
  - Sitting, standing detection
